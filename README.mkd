lastfmplayer
============

A simple shell wrapper around mplayer that scrobbles to last.fm.

Requirements
------------

- lastfmsubmitd
- perl
  - Music::Tag::MP3 (mp3 support)
  - Music::Tag::M4A (m4a support)

Usage
-----

Just call this script as you would call mplayer.

Song info will be submitted after you finish listening to the song;
if you are SKIPPING a track and don't want it to appear, press
Ctrl-C in mplayer - it will skip to the next track without
scrobbling.
